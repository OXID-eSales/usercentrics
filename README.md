This module provides the [Usercentrics](https://usercentrics.com/) functionality for the [OXID eShop](https://www.oxid-esales.com/) allowing you to use their Consent Management Platform.

## Usage

This assumes you have OXID eShop (at least the `v6.2.0` compilation) up and running.

### Install

The Usercentrics module is already included in the OXID eShop `v6.2.4`.

If you use an eShop version below >`v6.2.4` (for example `v6.2.0`), you can install the module with composer like that:
```bash
$ composer require oxid-professional-services/usercentrics
```

After requiring the module, you need to activate it, either via OXID eShop admin or CLI.

Navigate to oxideshop folder and execute the following: 
```bash
$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:activate oxps/usercentrics

```

### How to use

Activate the module and enter your usercentrics ID in the module settings.

## Testing

### Linting, syntax check, static analysis and unit tests

$ composer test
